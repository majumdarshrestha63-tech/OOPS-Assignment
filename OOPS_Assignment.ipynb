        "\n",
        "1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm (style of programming) that is based on the concept of objects which combines data (attributes) and behavior (methods) into a single unit. It helps to organize code in a way that is more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Classes are blueprint/template for creating an object. We are different objects of class human beings.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. An object is a real-world entity or an instance of a class that contains both data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. The concept of hiding complex implementation is known as Abstraction.\n",
        "The bundling of data and methods of a class is known as Encapsulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Dunder/Magic/ Special methods are the methods defined by built- in classes in python. These methods are defined type of methods for creating custom objects/ implementing overloading in python. Dunder means- d+under= double underscore- all the methods surrounding double underscore is a dunder method.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows one class (called the child or subclass) to acquire the properties and behaviors (methods and attributes) of another class (called the parent or base class). It promotes code reusability, extensibility, and helps create a clear class hierarchy.\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  Polymorphism- poly means many and morphism means forms/states- refers to an object taking several forms depending on the methods/ data.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  Python does not have strict access modifiers like private or protected (as in Java or C++), but it follows naming conventions to indicate access level:\n",
        "\n",
        "   Public Members- Accessible from anywhere\n",
        "\n",
        "   Protected Members (Convention) - Prefix with a single underscore _ to indicate “internal use only”.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Private Members- Prefix with two underscores __ — Python performs name mangling, making them harder to access directly.\n",
        "\n",
        "9.  A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when a new object of a class is created. It is mainly used to initialize (set up) the object’s attributes with initial values.\n",
        "\n",
        "10.  Class methods are bound to the class that  access / modify methods and attributes associated to the class. @classmethod decorator instead of self, class(not to a particular instance of the class, instead of self, class as first parameter).Static method does not modify class or instance state, access instance or class state, and not depend on class/instance. It behaves like a plain function that belongs to class, it does not take either self or class. @staticmethod is used.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. Method overloading- student method is taking different forms, the last method overloads the previous ones in the same class.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. Method Overriding- Method in parent class and child class with same signature, the child class method will be executed as well.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Property decorators are allowed to use class method as an attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "14. Polymorphism is important because it promotes flexibility, enables code reuse, simplifies maintenance and scalability and supports abstraction and clean architecture.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "15. An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, it serves as a blueprint for other classes. It defines abstract methods that must be implemented by any subclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "16. The advantages of OOP are as follows:-\n",
        "    \n",
        "    Modularity- Code is organized into manageable sections\n",
        "\n",
        "    Reusability- Existing code can be reused via inheritance\n",
        "\n",
        "    Encapsulation - Protects data and ensures controlled access\n",
        "\n",
        "    Polymorphism - Enables flexibility through method overriding\n",
        "\n",
        "    Abstraction - Simplifies interaction by hiding details\n",
        "\n",
        "    Maintainability - Easier debugging and updates\n",
        "\n",
        "    Scalability- Supports growth and new features easily\n",
        "\n",
        "17. Class Variable- Belongs to the class itself, not to any specific object (instance), shared by all instances of the class and defined inside the class, but outside any method.\n",
        "  Instance Variable- Belongs to a specific instance (object) of the class, each object has its own copy of instance variables and usually defined inside the __init__() method using self.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. One child class may inherit the property of multiple parent class is known as Multiple Inheritence.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. __str__() — User-Friendly Representation\n",
        "    \n",
        "    The __str__() method is meant to return a human-readable or user-friendly description of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is called when we use the print() function or str() on an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    __repr__() — Developer / Debug Representation\n",
        "    \n",
        "    The __repr__() method is meant to return a detailed or unambiguous string representation of an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It is mainly for developers and debugging.\n",
        "\n",
        "    It should ideally return a string that could recreate the object if passed to eval().\n",
        "\n",
        "20. The super() function in Python is used to call a method from the parent (or superclass) inside a subclass. It helps to ensure that the base class  behavior is properly executed without directly referring to its name.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. The __del__() method in Python is known as a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed that is, when it's no longer needed and Python's garbage collector is reclaiming its memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. @staticmethod- A static method is a method that does not depend on the class or instance.It behaves just like a regular function but belongs to the class's namespace.\n",
        "   @classmethod- A class method is a method that works on the class itself, not on instances.It receives the class (cls) as the first argument.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. When a child class (subclass) inherits from a parent class (superclass),it can override the parent's methods with its own version, then when we call that method on a subclass object, python automatically uses the child's version. This is runtime polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. Method chaining works when each method returns the object itself (usually self).That way,we can keep calling other methods on the same object.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. In Python, the __call__() method allows an object to be called like a function.It's one of Python's special (dunder) methods, and it gives objects function-like behavior while still maintaining state and class structure.\n",
        "\n",
        "   Defination- The __call__() method is automatically invoked when we use parentheses () after an object. In simple terms if a class defines a __call__() method, its instances can be called like functions.\n",
